		<h1>About Friends of the Park</h1>
		<p>Friends of the Parks (FOTP) is a 501(c)(3) park advocacy organization, dedicated to preserving, protecting, and improving Chicago’s parks and forest preserves for all citizens. Since 1975, FOTP has increased private and public commitment to Chicago’s parks through establishing park advisory councils, developing new parks, renovating playlots, and presenting public workshops and lectures to create and informed citizenry.</p>

		<h2>How Friends of the Parks Got Started</h2>
		<p>FOTP was formed in 1975 as a response to a Chicago Park District administration which ran our park system as a political patronage army and not for the benefit of citizens and taxpayers. Tax dollars were squandered; parks were in shambles; and there was no stewardship by the primary government agency entrusted with their protection. Evidence of the problems included poor landscape maintenance and horticultural practices; poorly attended recreational programs; parks isolated from the communities they served, inequitable distribution of tax dollars; and patronage that at times paralyzed the functioning of local parks.</p>

		<p>Friends of the Parks undertook studies of existing conditions of parks and recreation programs. Based on site surveys, report cards were produced which year after year showed failing grades by the political operatives that ran the Park District.</p>

		<p>The breakthrough to reform of the Park District came in 1986, when Mayor Harold Washington wrested control of the Park District from a political appointee, Edmund Kelly, and appointed world renowned architect, Walter Netsch, to serve as the President of the Park District Board.  Under Walter Netsch major reform was implemented at the Chicago Park District.</p>

		<h2>How Friends of the Parks Works for Change</h2>
		<p>FOTP completes policy studies on public trust issues including legal analyses, as well as reports on park management and stewardship. We work with community groups and individuals to build a strong park constituency to participate meaningfully in neighborhood park decision-making process. We develop new pilot park programs, such as the successful after-school program for children, which the Park District later adopted in parks throughout the city. We organize and sponsor regular workshops, member forums, park tours and symposia to educate and publicize environmental and park issues.</p>
